Apparently, the credentials you use for publishing to the cloud sandbox is not stored per workspace. As a result, you can't simply switch between cloud sandboxes, you have to clear the credentials cache first.If would be nice if you could set cloud sandbox tenant information that should used to publish to the online sandbox. Preferably the user id so you can clearly see what tenant is being used.During the publish process, the output only shows to which endpoint the package is published. It doesn't tell you anything about the tenant. Please add at least a line here with the actual user id being used.",

It's a pem certificate and private key which I combine in a PKCS12 file and import it using the built in function of the library and assign the array to the MQTTSession.certificates property.As far as I can see, that is the proper way to do it but I get a \"CFNetwork SSLHandshake failed (-9824 -> -9829)\" error.Also, debugging the connection from the server side using openssl gives the error \"peer did not return a certificate\".If I remove the server check for a client certificate, the connection works.Does the client certificate needs to be generate in a specific way? Using the pem generated client certificates from a python script establishes connection perfectly so in theory the certificates are correctly generated.Any ideas?Code:NSString*serverCertPath = [[NSBundlemainBundle]pathForResource:@\"server\"ofType:@\"der\"];NSData*serverCertData = [[NSDataalloc]initWithContentsOfFile:serverCertPath];\n\nMQTTSSLSecurityPolicy *policy = [MQTTSSLSecurityPolicypolicyWithPinningMode:MQTTSSLPinningModeCertificate];\npolicy.validatesDomainName =YES;\npolicy.allowInvalidCertificates =YES;\npolicy.pinnedCertificates = @[serverCertData];\n\n[_mqttManagerconnectTo:@\"hostname.com\"port:8883tls:YESkeepalive:3clean:YESauth:YESuser:@\"[some user]\"pass:@\"[some password]\"will:YESwillTopic:@\"[some topic]\"willMsg:[@\"[some message]\"dataUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding]willQos:MQTTQosLevelAtMostOncewillRetainFlag:NOwithClientId:@\"[some client id]\"securityPolicy:policycertificates:[MQTTCFSocketTransportclientCertsFromP12:[[NSBundlemainBundle]pathForResource:@\"mqtt-client-cert\"ofType:@\"p12\"]passphrase:@\"mqtt\"]];",

    "question": "Hi,ForHSTS preloading, we need 18 weeks (126 days) andat least 180 days to be considered A+ on SSL Labs.To be useful, the lifetime of a TLS certificate and the private key should be at least the double of the validity period of HPKP, soat least 120 days(2 x 60 days), so the system admin engineers could have the possibility to overcome a serious problem.The comfort zone is one year if we keep in mind the necessary time and required testing for the replacement of the private key.With DANE/TLSA and DNSSEC enabled, each renewal of the TLS certificate byletsencryptrequires that every Let's Encrypt user has the time to regularly modify (= each 90 days) its DNS zone to add the new TLSA DNS resource record. The renewal of domain names are - for the most part - made every year, it would be smarter to be synchronized with that.It's better to deliver one-year certificates to empower users to use the whole TLS stack and not the bare minimum. If you have some really great research papers to keep the 90 days validity by default, you should at least offer the option to generate one-year certificates, because in the Let's Encrypt CA offering, it seems that we are advised to renew - more manually than automatically in the facts - every 90 days the TLS certificate and the private key, and also avoid additional configuration with HPKP, DANE/TLSA and HSTS. Let's Encrypt should be secure by default.Thanks in advance,HLFH",

This approach relies on a \"meshed\" prometheus label being set by the proxy when reporting metics. Following the discussion in#386 (comment), we need to switch this code to use the \"tls\" label instead.It's also the case that, for backwards compatibility, the \"tls\" label will only be set when the value is true, and it will be omitted otherwise. This will require some small tweaks to the way in which we structure our queries.Relates to#1017.",

    "question": "Greetings all,Congratulations and thanks for all this work you have done so far and the quest to implement post quantum algorithms into current cryptography protocols.First of all I have to state that I have pretty basic knowledge of programming languages, but I can handle various operating systems. Lately I had the interest to start learning about cryptography and started encrypting my connection, playing around with the various available classic protocols etc.I have successfully installed your software in both *nix based and microsoft platforms of mine, at least up to the openssl-integrated-with-liboqs stage, but still I am not sure I have understood how I should form the tls-cipher and/or tls-ciphersuites (for the openssl 1.1.1d version I use) directive to handle the oqskex. Also the openssl certificates I issue with the openssl commands (openssl seems to have been integrated correctly since I can use it for -at least- most of the pq algorithms) seem not readable from my openvpn software on neither side. (It provides various certificate related errors such as the \"unsupported certificate purpose\" / \"certificate verify failed\" / extended key usage errors etc.)I reached as far as I could alone, but I think I will need your help to go further. I use Debian Buster and Windows 10 Pro Edition.Any help and recommendation will be appreciated. Keep up the good work.Best regards,Alex",

Initially I thought that this was an issue ifpassport::useClientModel()is used to override the defaultoauth_clientstable. But it looks like the command is setting the values ofsecretcolumn back to their original values in the foreach loop. I hope somebody can correct me if I am wrong. Otherwise, I will make a pull request for this. Also, it's worth mentioning that the command is checkingPASSWORD_BCRYPTalgo specifically which kinda strengthens my claim over at#1276and I believe this should also be changed to consume settings of the main app.Steps To Reproduce:Setup Passport's mentioned versionCreate a few clients for testing.Runphp artisan passport:hashto hash existing client secrets.You will see that the secrets have not been hashed.",

    "question": "I mainly use it to sync with simplenote.  I assume until I hear otherwise all the text is stored in the clear in their database.  So I'd like to have some way to encrypt within a note.  Say I could select a block of text (or have it be the entire note) and encrypt it with a password I supply in real time (and perhaps optionally store it the keychain or something).  Backend it could be something as standard as AES and just hash out the password to get the keylength you need.  In fact it would be better if it was something fairly simple so app developers on other operating systems could implement it as well.  And I'm sure there's a ton of AES libraries around so the encryption part wouldn't be so hard (although interfacing with keychain might)",

    "question": "CVE-2019-11253is a denial of service vulnerability in the kube-apiserver, allowing authorized users sending malicious YAML or JSON payloads to cause kube-apiserver to consume excessive CPU or memory, potentially crashing and becoming unavailable. This vulnerability has been given an initial severity of High, with a score of 7.5 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).Prior to v1.14.0, default RBAC policy authorized anonymous users to submit requests that could trigger this vulnerability. Clusters upgraded from a version prior to v1.14.0 keep the more permissive policy by default for backwards compatibility. See the mitigation section below for instructions on how to install the more restrictive v1.14+ policy.Affected versions:Kubernetes v1.0.0-1.12.xKubernetes v1.13.0-1.13.11, resolved in v1.13.12 by[1.13] Automated cherry pick of #83261: bump gopkg.in/yaml.v2 v2.2.4#83436Kubernetes v1.14.0-1.14.7, resolved in v1.14.8 by[1.14] Automated cherry pick of #83261: bump gopkg.in/yaml.v2 v2.2.4#83435Kubernetes v1.15.0-1.15.4, resolved in v1.15.5 by[1.15] Automated cherry pick of #83261: bump gopkg.in/yaml.v2 v2.2.4#83434Kubernetes v1.16.0-1.16.1, resolved in v1.16.2 by[1.16] Automated cherry pick of #83261: bump gopkg.in/yaml.v2 v2.2.4#83433All four patch releases are now available.Fixed in master by#83261Mitigation:Requests that are rejected by authorization do not trigger the vulnerability, so managing authorization rules and/or access to the Kubernetes API server mitigates which users are able to trigger this vulnerability.To manually apply the more restrictive v1.14.x+ policy, either as a pre-upgrade mitigation, or as an additional protection for an upgraded cluster, save theattached fileasrbac.yaml, and run:kubectl auth reconcile -f rbac.yaml --remove-extra-subjects --remove-extra-permissionsNote: this removes the ability for unauthenticated users to usekubectl auth can-iIf you are running a version prior to v1.14.0:in addition to installing the restrictive policy, turn off autoupdate for this clusterrolebinding so your changes aren?€?t replaced on an API server restart:kubectl annotate --overwrite clusterrolebinding/system:basic-user rbac.authorization.kubernetes.io/autoupdate=falseafter upgrading to v1.14.0 or greater, you can remove this annotation to reenable autoupdate:kubectl annotate --overwrite clusterrolebinding/system:basic-user rbac.authorization.kubernetes.io/autoupdate=true=============Original description follows:IntroductionPosting this as an issue following report to the security list who suggested putting it here as it's already public in a Stackoverflow questionhereWhat happened:When creating a ConfigMap object which has recursive references contained in it, excessive CPU usage can occur.  This appears to be an instance of a\"Billion Laughs\" attackwhich is quite well known as an XML parsing issue.Applying this manifest to a cluster causes the client to hang for some time with considerable CPU usage.apiVersion: v1\ndata:\n  a: &a [\"web\",\"web\",\"web\",\"web\",\"web\",\"web\",\"web\",\"web\",\"web\"]\n  b: &b [*a,*a,*a,*a,*a,*a,*a,*a,*a]\n  c: &c [*b,*b,*b,*b,*b,*b,*b,*b,*b]\n  d: &d [*c,*c,*c,*c,*c,*c,*c,*c,*c]\n  e: &e [*d,*d,*d,*d,*d,*d,*d,*d,*d]\n  f: &f [*e,*e,*e,*e,*e,*e,*e,*e,*e]\n  g: &g [*f,*f,*f,*f,*f,*f,*f,*f,*f]\n  h: &h [*g,*g,*g,*g,*g,*g,*g,*g,*g]\n  i: &i [*h,*h,*h,*h,*h,*h,*h,*h,*h]\nkind: ConfigMap\nmetadata:\n  name: yaml-bomb\n  namespace: defaultWhat you expected to happen:Ideally it would be good for a maximum size of entity to be defined, or perhaps some limit on recursive references in YAML parsed by kubectl.One note is that the original poster on Stackoverflow indicated that the resource consumption was inkube-apiserverbut both tests I did (1.16 client against 1.15 Kubeadm cluster and 1.16 client against 1.16 kubeadm cluster) showed the CPU usage client-side.How to reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible):Get the manifest above and apply to a cluster as normal withkubectl create -f <manifest>.

But here's the problem: i don't care if build pass and don't want noise.So, fix for this case would be to open PRs , but assign me only if the build fail, so i will go and look what's happening.Currently, i'm usingbranch-pushonly because don't care about passing builds, but i want to see the PRs and so others to be able to see that PRs, not just some commits by some bot. I want users to see that other bots (such as codecov comments) and services (such as travis and nodesecurity) pass.

    "question": "QuestionWe have a ruby on rails application that uses a number of different libraries such as libmysqlclient, and librdkafka and libcurl that then use openssl including ruby itself.It seems that each of these libraries implementation uses its own CRYPTO_set_locking_callback implementation that then has its own mutex etc.Some check for existing callbacks and others don't.Here are the implementations onlinelibmysqlclient that uses the openssl_lock_function here - see -https://github.com/mysql/mysql-server/blob/7d10c82196c8e45554f27c00681474a9fb86d137/vio/viosslfactories.cc#L421librdkafka can be found here - see -https://github.com/edenhill/librdkafka/blob/cedb2917396ddb02a853330adf5030506abdebf3/src/rdkafka_ssl.c#L1390Ideally, I would like them to use one implementation of the CRYPTO_set_locking_callback API call but it depends on the order they are initialized.In the example above libmysqlclient doesn't look for existing callbacks which I would argue is a bug?Ideally, I would like to just have it (that is CRYPTO_set_locking_callback) called once and for the other calls to delegate to the first caller somehow or maybe my own version.If I use something like a trampoline to capture all calls to CRYPTO_get_locking_callback and CRYPTO_set_locking_callback is that in violation of FIPS ?Is there an easy way to ensure there is only one CRYPTO_set_locking_callback implementation being used?I understand this is not an issue with openssl 1.1 and above but we have to use 1.0.2 due to FIPS.",

    "question": "Hi there,the user module works for the most part when adding a user to Solaris nodes, however it does not work correctly with passwords.My python skills are basically non-existent, but I'm guessing the issue lies here (first example of this code, it reoccurs later on):77         elif key == 'password' and kwargs[key] is not None:\n 78             cmd.append('-p')\n 79             cmd.append(kwargs[key])i.e. use the -p feature of (GNU) useradd/usermod/etc.  Unfortunately on Solaris, -p is for \"project name\", so trying to set a user password with i.e. name=newuser password=Welcome1 we get the hilarious response:\"msg\": \"UX: /usr/sbin/usermod: ERROR: project Welcome1 does not exist. \n Choose another.\\nUX: /usr/sbin/usermod: Welcome1 name should be all\n lower case or numeric.\\n\",The usual way to bulk script password changes for Solaris is with expect, cssh or pssh, which is what I'm trying to get away from, and instead use ansible.The other way is to work with the shadowfile directly.  There's a few ways to achieve this with ansible already, (e.g. raw module + sed, lineinfile module) but that lacks appropriate file locking (unless you playbook a sequence I guess), and the user module should look after this anyway IMHO.Solaris defaults to simple crypt passwords with a 2-char salt e.g.python -c 'import crypt; print crypt.crypt(\"Welcome1\",\"DC\")'\nDC5qa4BDdc6jIIf you manually vi that into /etc/shadow, \"newuser\" can now login with the password \"Welcome1\".However, beware that Sol 9 onwards allows md5 encryption on passwords, the way to check being something like:grep \"CRYPT_DEFAULT=\" /etc/security/policy.conf | grep -v \"#\"\nCRYPT_DEFAULT=__unix__In this instance,unixis returned, which means plain old crypt.As it stands, the user module creates the user and a shadow entry appears like so:Sol8:newuser:*LK*:::::::Sol10:newuser:UP:::::::Ideally it would look more like (using DC for the password salt, obviously you want to randomise)newuser:DC5qa4BDdc6jI:0::::::Other nice-to-haves (possibly another issue ticket) would be user locking, unlocking and expiry to force a password change at next login.  This would possibly use state=locked, state=unlocked and state=expired respectively.passwd -l  for locking appears to exist in most versions of passwdpasswd -u for unlocking appears in some versionspasswd -d appears to be the alternative to unlockingpasswd -f exists in a couple of versions of passwd for forcing a password changechage -d 0 appears to be the Linux alternative for the aboveAgain, yes, all of these can be done with the raw module, but it would still be preferable to have the user module handle it IMHO.  If this does get to be too hard though, maybe it would be easiest to split the user module off into OS specific modules e.g. user-linux, user-sunos, user-hpux and so on.Hope that braindump wasn't too messy to follow.  I'm looking forward to the discussion.",

Of about 5 people, only two users (IT staff -so they have admin rights) are unable to see the asset page of any new assets we've added (/hardware//view)If they go to /hardware, they are able to see the [correct] list of our existing inventory, however, any asset tag that these two users click redirects them to one of the asset pages for one of the seeded dummy assets (id 1-12).   For example, selecting the asset tag for an asset with ID=22 will go to/hardware/1/viewrather than/hardware/22/view.Searching through the existing issues, the closest one I could find was#557.  I did the steps in that ticket (backup db-->re-seed db-->import backup db-->remove seeded assets) but this did not resolve the problem.  I've closely monitored both the webserver logs and the snipe-it logs while one of the users tested this, and the apache logs only show the paths that are being returned, and do not indicate what is incorrectly redirecting these users.  Similarly, the snipe-it logs did not show any messages other than the user logging in, while we tested this.  Debug mode was turned on during all this testing and there were also no additional error messages shown in the browser.Since I have deleted the seeded dummy assets in the database, these two users now get the \"This asset does not exist\" error message when they click on any asset in the list.I've had these two users try on different browsers and computers which made no difference.The one last thing I need to test is seeing if deleting the user, and re-importing (from LDAP) will fix the issue for them.  But I will do this in the morning since both users have left the office for the day.Any suggestions or pointers on further troubleshooting this would be appreciated.Regards.",
