1. [Encryption Techniques]
Definition: Involves methods used to convert information into a secure, unreadable format to protect confidentiality. This includes encryption algorithms, encoding schemes, and cryptographic protocols.
2. [Permission Management]
Definition: Focuses on controlling access to resources through authentication and authorization mechanisms, including user identity verification and token-based access control.
[Network Security]
Definition: Concerns the protection of data during transmission over networks, including secure communication protocols and verification tools such as digital certificates.
4. [Data Security]
Definition: Involves measures to protect data at rest and during usage, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity through secure storage and digital signatures.
5. [Software Vulnerability]
Definition: Relates to weaknesses or flaws in software that can be exploited, such as memory issues, injection attacks, race conditions, and security bugs.
6. [Secure Development]
Definition: Focuses on building software with security in mind, including secure coding practices, safe use of libraries, secure configurations, and handling vulnerability reports in development platforms.
