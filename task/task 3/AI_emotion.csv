Flakiness    This issue caused flaky tests during development  particularly while working on issue    574 
Solution    You added an additional notification mechanism to ensure that the server is fully initialized before returning control to the caller  This helps prevent accessing an uninitialized server object  thus avoiding segmentation faults
